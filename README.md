# Item-System

This is my humble item system written in Unity 5. You can edit the icons and stats as your own wish. 

Create Item: Creates an item with type options "weapon, armor, consumable and crafting".
Upgrade System: Increases all stats by 1.
Disenchant System: Disenchants the item into Metal, Dust or Gem(more rare).
Remove Item: Removes the item.

Bank System: Extracts data from the item database and sells the items to the player. (Money system will be added soon.)

The equip slots are on the right side of the inventory. Character stats and potion(consumable) using will be added on the following updates.
